## üöÄ Quickstart

Installation should generally work by checking out this repository and running `pip install` on it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:timothygebhard/fm4ar.git ;
cd fm4ar ;
pip install -e .
```

For developer mode (e.g., unit tests, linters, ...), replace the last line with:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```


## üèï Setting up the environment

The code in here relies on some environmental variables that you need to set:

```bash
export FM4AR_DATASETS_DIR=/path/to/datasets ;
export FM4AR_EXPERIMENTS_DIR=/path/to/experiments ;
```

You might want to add these lines to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

Generally, these folders can be subfolders of this repository; however, there may exists scenarios where this is not desirable (e.g., on a cluster).


## üê≠ Tests

This repository comes with a rather extensive set of unit tests (based on [`pytest`](https://pytest.org)). 
After installing `ml4ptp` with the `[develop]` option, the tests can be run as:

```bash
pytest tests
```

You can also use these tests to ensure that the code is still working when you update the dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
